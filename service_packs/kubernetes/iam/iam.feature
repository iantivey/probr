Feature: Ensure stringent authentication and authorisation
  As a Security Auditor
  I want to ensure that stringent authentication and authorisation policies are applied to my organisation's Kubernetes clusters
  So that only approved actors have the ability to perform sensitive operations in order to prevent malicious attacks on my organization

  Background:
    Given a Kubernetes cluster is deployed

    @probes/kubernetes/iam/AZ-AAD-AI-1.0 @control_type/preventative @csp/azure
    Scenario Outline: Prevent cross namespace Azure Identities
        And an AzureIdentityBinding called "probr-aib" exists in the namespace called "default"
        When I create a simple pod in "<NAMESPACE>" namespace assigned with the "probr-aib" AzureIdentityBinding
        Then the pod is deployed successfully
        But an attempt to obtain an access token from that pod should "<RESULT>"

        Examples:
			| NAMESPACE     | RESULT  |
			| the probr     | Fail    |
			| the default   | Succeed |

    @probes/kubernetes/iam/AZ-AAD-AI-1.1 @control_type/preventative @csp/azure
    Scenario: Prevent cross namespace Azure Identity Bindings
        And the namespace called "default" has an AzureIdentity called "probr-probe"
        When I create an AzureIdentityBinding called "probr-aib" in the Probr namespace bound to the "probr-probe" AzureIdentity
        And I deploy a pod assigned with the "probr-aib" AzureIdentityBinding into the Probr namespace
        Then the pod is deployed successfully
        But an attempt to obtain an access token from that pod should fail

  @probes/kubernetes/iam/AZ-AAD-AI-1.2 @control_type/preventative @csp/azure
  Scenario: Prevent access to AKS credentials via Azure Identity Components
    And the cluster has managed identity components deployed
    When I execute the command "cat /etc/kubernetes/azure.json" against the MIC pod
    Then Kubernetes should prevent me from running the command
