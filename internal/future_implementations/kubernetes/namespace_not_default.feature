  As a Cloud Security Admin
  I want to ensure that resources in a kubernetes cluster are not in the default namespace
  So that my organization can apply security contexts at that level

  Rule: ...

    Scenario Outline: Resources in the kubernetes cluster should not be uploaded into the default namespace
      Given an active Kubernetes cluster exists which we can make changes to
      And some system exists which can detect if resources are uploaded into the default namespace
      When a resource is uploaded to the kubernetes cluster
      And the system rules that the upload <NameSpace> uploaded to the default namespace
      Then upload will <Result> with error <Error Message>

      Examples:
        | NameSpace | Result  | Error Message                                           |
        | Was       | Fail    | A resource can't be uploaded with the default namespace |
        | Was Not   | Succeed | No error will show                                      |
