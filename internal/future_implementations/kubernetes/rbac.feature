  To limit the scope of malicious activities/ mistakes

    Scenario Outline: detect when users attempt to access permissions outside those which they are allowed
      Given an active kubernetes cluster exists which we can make changes to
      And some system exists which can detect when a user attempts to access denied permissions
      When a user attempts to access <PermissionsGranted> permissions
      Then the system will <Result> with an error <ErrorMessage>

      Examples:
        | PermissionsGranted | Result  | ErrorMessage                                        |
        | Denied             | Fail    | Your role does not have access to these permissions |
        | Allowed            | Succeed | No error would show                                 |
