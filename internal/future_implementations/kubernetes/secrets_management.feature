  So that my organization can ensure that secrets are not easily discovered by reviewing the network logs

  Rule: ...

    Scenario Outline: Prevent secrets from being stored as environmental variables
      Given an active Kubernetes cluster exists
      And Some system exists to detect how and when secrets are being defined
      When secrets are being defined

      Examples:
        | Secret Type            | Result  | Error Message                               |
        | File                   | Succeed | No error will show                          |
        | Environmental Variable | Fail    | Secrets should be stored as a separate file |
