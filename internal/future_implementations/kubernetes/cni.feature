  As a Cloud Security Admin
  I want to ensure that kubernetes deployments do not run without Network policies enabled
  So that my organization can ensure that the CNI is secure

  Rule: ...

    Scenario Outline: Ensure that the CNI supports Network Policies
      Given a created kubernetes cluster has a working CNI which can be interacted with
      When a kubernetes cluster is created
      And and the cluster's CNI has Network Policies <Network Policy Used>
      Then the cluster's creation will <Result> with an error <Error Message>

      Examples:
        | Network Policy Used | Result  | Error Message                                |
        | enabled             | Succeed |                                              |
        | disabled            | Fail    | Network Policies must be enabled on this CNI |
